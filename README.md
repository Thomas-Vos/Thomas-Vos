### Hi, I'm Thomas Vos ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm a software engineer at SmartFusionLabs where I create mobile applications.

Currently spending most of my time on [Hue Essentials](https://hueessentials.com), a smart lighting app, which is available since 2017 for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, watchOS, Wear OS, and Android TV. To ensure consistency across platforms, I use Kotlin Multiplatform for shared business logic (since 2018) and use modern UI frameworks like AndroidX Compose (Multiplatform) and SwiftUI, both of which I adopted in 2019.

Also working on another app called [Remote Gamepad](https://remotegamepad.com), an app that turns smartphones into game controllers for PCs. This app is available on iOS and Android and works using a server app I developed using Kotlin/Native (with native C interop for virtual controllers) for Windows and Linux.

Before these projects, I built several Android apps using Java and Android views in XML. My earlier work includes Root Essentials and Fingerprint Gestures, both of which reached millions of downloads on Google Play.
